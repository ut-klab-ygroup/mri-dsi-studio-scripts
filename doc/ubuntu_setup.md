If you encounter the error while loading shared libraries: libQt6Charts.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory, ensure all dependencies from Step 2 are installed.

### Step 5: Make DSI Studio Globally Accessible:

To run DSI Studio from any directory (from anywhere), add the DSI Studio directory to your PATH environment variable.


Depending on the shell you are using, open the appropriate configuration file:

**Note:** If you are unsure which shell you are using, you can check by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

The output will look something like this:

```
/bin/bash
```

or

```
/bin/zsh
```

Then please add the path to configuration based on your shell:

- For `bash`:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

- For `zsh`:

```
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following line to the PATH in the end of the file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/directory/dsi-studio
```

Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path where you extracted DSI Studio.

Save and close the file:
- To save the file in Nano, press `Ctrl + O`, then Enter.
- To exit Nano, press `Ctrl + X`

Apply the changes in the terminal:


- For `bash`:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

- For `zsh`:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 6: Verify the Changes:

Open a new terminal window or tab and type:

```
dsi_studio
```

DSI Studio should now run from any location if not change the path again.
